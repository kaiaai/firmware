## Configuration
Once you have uploaded firmware and the sketch data) to your Kaia.ai-compatible robot:
- wait for your robot to enter the AP (WiFi access point) mode
  - the robot enters the AP (WiFi access point) mode whenever the robot fails to connect to WiFi
- Alternatively, force your robot to enter the AP mode by performing a "factory reset":
  - Press the "EN" (reset) button on your ESP32 board.
  - Next, immediately after that (within 1 second) press the ESP32 "BOOT" button and hold it for 10+ seconds.
  - The ESP32 board LED will blink fast.
  - Release the "BOOT" button once the ESP32 board LED stops blinking.
- connect to your robot's WiFi (MAKERSPET)
- navigate your browser (PC or mobile handset) to 192.168.4.1
- configure your robot and its WiFi connection:
  - input your WiFi name, password
  - select your robot's model
  - select your robot's laser sensor from the [list of supported LiDAR/LDS](https://github.com/kaiaai/LDS)
  - select your robot's motor model
- press the "Configure and Connect" button
  - disconnect from your robot's WiFi and reconnect back to your own WiFi

This [blog post](https://kaia.ai/blog/arduino-platform-firmware-avaiable/) discusses the configuration in more detail.

## Compatible Motors

### Brushless (BLDC) Motors
- BLDC motors with these specifications should (generally) work:
  - 9..24V voltage (higher voltage increases efficiency)
  - models JGA25-2418, JGA25-2430; 24.4mm outer diameter
  - ~190..450 no-load (max) RPM, ~140..350 rated RPM
  - JST SH 1.0mm 5-pin connector on the back (PWM, CW/CCW, VMOT, GND, FG)
  - built-in BLDC driver and encoder
  - ~0.5..1.5 Kg*cm rated torque 
- Examples
  - CHR-GM25-BL2418 24V 200RPM 270PPR
  - JGA25-BL2418 24V 245RPM 630PPR
  - CHR-GM25-BL2418 24V 260RPM 204PPR
  - JGA25-BL2418 24V 408RPM 127.8PPR
  - CHR-GM25-BL2418 24V 450RPM 120PPR

### Brushed Motors
- Brushed motors with these specifications should (generally) works
  - 9..24V voltage (higher voltage increases efficiency)
  - GA25-370 size; 24.4mm outer diameter
  - ~190..450 no-load (max) RPM, ~140..350 rated RPM
  - quadrature encoder
  - 6-pin connector (VMOT+, VMOT-, ENC_A, ENC_B, VENC+, GND)
- N20 motors
  - can be connected, but not recommended due to their low power
- L298N motor driver is required when using brushed motors

### Where to Purchase Motors/Components
- Amazon
- AliExpress
- Ebay
- online robotics specialty stores
  - robotshop.com
  - in India robu.in, zbotic.in, robokits.co.in, robocraze.com, roboticsdna.in, probots.co.in, roboindia.com, flipkart.com

### Choosing a Motor
- choose a motor with a minimum rated torque of ~0.5Kg*cm (a guess). Your motor must have enough torque
  - to accelerate the weight of your robot reasonably quickly, let's say 2lbs or so
  - to drive over thick carpet, floor mats, etc.
- for the given rated torque, choose a motor with the highest RPM
  - the higher the motor RPM, the faster your robot can drive
- we recommend 24V BLDC ~400 RPM motors, e.g. JGA25-BL2418 24V 408RPM 127.8PPR
  - these motors are fast, powerful and (generally) long-lasting
- 12V BLDC ~300 RPM is the second choice
  - often 12V BLDC offer less torque at the same RPM compared to 24V BLDC motors
- if you cannot get a BLDC motor, get yourself a brushed GA25-370 motor with encoder
  - this motor is (generally) less powerful compared to the recommended BLDC motors
  - brushed motors (generally) do not last as long as BLDC motors
- if you cannot get a GA25-370 motor, you can use N20 motors as the last resort
  - N20 motors have considerably less torque compared to the recommended motors
  - However, some N20 motors with low RPM (e.g. <=100RPM) do offer sufficient torque
